# iTunes 11-inspired color matching

A browser-based implementation of iTunes 11's color matching. Inspired by Panic's [iTunes 11 and
Colors](https://www.panic.com/blog/itunes-11-and-colors/) blog post.

## Running

To avoid problems with cross-origin requests, the sample must be run in a web server. For example:

```
$ npm install http-server -g
$ http-server
```
